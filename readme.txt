Optimizes your assets (images, css, js, fonts) for faster site loading so they are loaded by StaticOptimizer Optimization servers.

== Description ==

Static Optimizer is a static file optimization cloud service that speeds up your site by optimizing and serving (the selected) static files from your site.
The service automatically optimizes & compresses the files automatically.
No database or files changes are performed therefore there's no risk if you want to uninstall the plugin later (... but why would you?)
If our optimization server are down (upgrade, maintenance or outage) your original files will be loaded instead.

= Features / Benefits =
* Easy to set up. Just get your API key and you're good to go.
* Automatic js and css minification & compression
* Automatic image optimization (gif, jpeg, png)
* Simple to use

= How it works =

After you get your API key the plugin will install as a system (mu-plugin) and will correct where the selected files are loaded from.
During the plugin configuration you can tell the plugin which files you'd like to be optimized.

= Who is this plugin for? =
People who have lots of images on their site such online stores, photographers.
